there are two ways to keep color
1.  a b a--> two corner same
2. a b c---> two corner different

now if we place other three on adjacent

   1---> two corner same---> to keep this value will depend on two different way of previous

        therefore current 2 colour===p* 2colourprevious + q* 2colorprevious  ....> p and q constant 
  
  in this same way two corner different color
