   2. Suppose you have a matrix A with n rows and n columns (we’ll call such matrices “square matrix of size n”). We can define matrix exponentiation as: Ax = A * A * A * … * A (x times) with special case of x = 0: A0 = In. Its kind of same as number exponentiation. TC: logx*(n^3). Naive -> x*(n^3).
   3. Implementation is exactly same as number once, instead of multiply number we will multiply matrix.
   4. Nth fibonacci number can be find in logn with the help of matrix multiplication.
