1. Floyd's cycle detection.
- if there is cycle, if we start at some point with slow and fast point.
- if there is cycle they will meeting.
- to find starting point: move another point from start , second from there one by one.
- where they meet that the starting point.
- Intuition: Not sure.

x + y -> first meet

2*(x+y) = zc + y + x
2x+2y = zc + y+ x
x+y = zc 
x = zc-y
